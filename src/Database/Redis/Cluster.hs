-- This module implements a clustered connection whilst maintaining
-- compatibility with the original Hedis codebase. In particular it still
-- performs implicit pipelining using `unsafeInterleaveIO` as the single node
-- codebase does. To achieve this each connection carries around with it a
-- pipeline of commands. Every time `sendRequest` is called the command is
-- added to the pipeline and an IO action is returned which will, upon being
-- evaluated, execute the entire pipeline. If the pipeline is already executed
-- then it just looks up it's response in the executed pipeline.

-- The approach we take here is similar to that taken by the redis-py-cluster

--
-- Essentially we group all the commands by node (based on the current shardmap)
-- and then execute a pipeline for each node (maintaining the order of commands
-- on a per node basis but not between nodes). Once we've done this, if any of
-- the commands have resulted in a MOVED error we refresh the shard map, then
-- we run through all the responses and retry any MOVED or ASK errors. This retry
-- step is not pipelined, there is a request per error. This is probably
-- acceptable in most cases as these errors should only occur in the case of
-- cluster reconfiguration events, which should be rare.
